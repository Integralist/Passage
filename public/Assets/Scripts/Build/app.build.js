 * Use NodeJs to execute the r.js optimization script on this build script
 * node r.js -o app.build.js
 *
 * See: https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/example.build.js for an example build script
 *
 * If you specify just the name (with no includes/excludes) then all modules are combined into the "main" file.
 * You can include/exclude specific modules though if needed (this helps with 'lazy loading' scripts)
 *
 * You can also set optimize: "none" (or more specific uglifyjs settings) if you need to.
 *
 * Node: if you set relative paths then do them relative to the baseUrl
