#Passage

##Description

Since learning Ruby (along with the Sinatra framework) I wanted to set-up a template project that I could refer to whenever starting up a new web based Ruby project.

The name "Passage" is an associated word related to "routing" (which in principle is what the Sinatra framework is most notorious for).

##TODO

I've got lots to do on this project but a few items I can think of at the moment is...

* Put together a basic site
* Enhance it with more dynamic content
* Look into possibility of dynamically loading sub content into a .erb file
* Look at setting up a database for loading content from
* Look at setting up a contact form
* Look into error handling and 404 error pages
* Look at building XML site map automatically
* Write a blog post on all my findings

...this is all basic stuff, but I haven't got time for at the moment.
